# Python Lambda

# Program 1 :
   
Write a Python program to filter the height and width of students, which are stored in a dictionary using lambda.

# Program-2 : 
   
Write a Python program to extract the nth element from a given list of tuples using lambda.

# Program-3 :
    Write a Python program to sort a list of lists by a given index of the inner list using lambda.
    Original list:
[('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98)]
Sort the said list of lists by a given index ( Index = 0 ) of the inner list
[('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99), ('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94)]
Sort the said list of lists by a given index ( Index = 2 ) of the inner list
[('Wyatt Knott', 91, 94), ('Brady Kent', 97, 96), ('Beau Turnbull', 94, 98), ('Greyson Fulton', 98, 99)]

# Program-4 :
    Write a Python program to remove all elements from a given list present in another list using lambda.
    Original lists:
list1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
list2: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Remove all elements from 'list1' present in 'list2:
[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10]

# Program-5 :
  Write a Python program to find the elements of a given list of strings that contain specific substring using lambda.

  Original list:
['red', 'black', 'white', 'green', 'orange']
Substring to search:
ack
Elements of the said list that contain specific substring:
['black']
Substring to search:
abc
Elements of the said list that contain specific substring:
[]

# Program-6 : 
  Write a Python program to find the nested lists elements, which are present in another list using lambda.

    Original lists: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
[[12, 18, 23, 25, 45], [7, 11, 19, 24, 28], [1, 5, 8, 18, 15, 16]]
Intersection of said nested lists:
[[12], [7, 11], [1, 5, 8]]

# Program-7 :
  Write a Python program to calculate the product of a given list of numbers using lambda.

  list1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Product of the said list numbers:
3628800
list2: [2.2, 4.12, 6.6, 8.1, 8.3]
Product of the said list numbers:
4021.8599520000007
