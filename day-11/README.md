Binary Search : In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The binary search algorithm can be classified as a dichotomies divide-and-conquer search algorithm and executes in logarithmic time.
Test Data :
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 6) -> False
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 5) -> True
