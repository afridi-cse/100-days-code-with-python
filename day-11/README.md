# Python 

# Program 1 :
Write a Python program for binary search.
Binary Search : In computer science, a binary search or half-interval search algorithm finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. The binary search algorithm can be classified as a dichotomies divide-and-conquer search algorithm and executes in logarithmic time.
Test Data :
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 6) -> False
binary_search([1,2,3,5,8], 5) -> True

# Program-2 : 
Write a Python program for sequential search. Go to the editor
Sequential Search : In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a method for finding a particular value in a list that checks each element in sequence until the desired element is found or the list is exhausted. The list need not be ordered.
Test Data :
Sequential_Search([11,23,58,31,56,77,43,12,65,19],31) -> (True, 3)
